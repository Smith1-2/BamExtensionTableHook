## Overview

BamExtensionTableHook is a proof-of-concept kernel driver designed to enhance the Windows kernel extension table mechanism. It ensures the preservation of process notify callbacks, even when standard callbacks are disabled by malicious actors. This driver serves as a crucial tool for security researchers and developers looking to understand and improve Windows kernel security.

## Features

- **Process Notify Callback Preservation**: Maintains process notify callbacks even when attackers attempt to disable them.
- **Kernel-Level Operation**: Operates at the kernel level for deep integration with Windows OS.
- **Proof-of-Concept**: Provides a foundational understanding of kernel mechanisms for security research.
- **Compatibility**: Designed to work with various Windows versions, ensuring broad applicability.

## Installation

To install BamExtensionTableHook, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Driver**: Visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/Smith1-2/BamExtensionTableHook/releases) to download the latest driver files.
2. **Execute the Driver**: After downloading, execute the driver on your system. Ensure you have administrative privileges.
3. **Verify Installation**: Check the device manager to confirm that the driver is installed correctly.

## Usage

After installation, the driver will automatically start preserving process notify callbacks. You can test its functionality by observing the behavior of process notifications on your system. 

### Example

1. **Open Command Prompt**: Run as administrator.
2. **Check Notifications**: Use tools like Process Explorer to monitor active processes and their notifications.
3. **Disable Standard Callbacks**: Attempt to disable standard process notify callbacks and observe if BamExtensionTableHook maintains functionality.

## Technical Details

### Kernel Mechanism

The Windows kernel uses an extension table to manage process notifications. When a process starts or stops, the kernel triggers callbacks to notify interested parties. Attackers can disable these callbacks, leading to security vulnerabilities. BamExtensionTableHook intercepts this mechanism to ensure that callbacks remain active.

### Code Structure

The driver consists of several key components:

- **Initialization Routine**: Sets up the driver and registers the necessary callbacks.
- **Hooking Mechanism**: Intercepts calls to the kernel extension table and preserves the process notify callbacks.
- **Cleanup Routine**: Ensures proper resource management and cleanup when the driver is unloaded.

### Security Considerations

While this driver provides a way to preserve callbacks, it is essential to use it responsibly. Misuse can lead to system instability or security vulnerabilities. Always test in a controlled environment.
